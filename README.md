# Market-Basket-Analysis
A] Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm

This repository contains Python code for performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using the Apriori algorithm. Market Basket Analysis is a popular technique in data mining and association rule learning that helps identify relationships between items frequently purchased together by customers.

B] What is Market Basket Analysis?

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that aims to uncover associations or relationships between products that are frequently purchased together by customers. It is widely used in the retail industry to understand customer purchasing behavior, optimize product placement, and suggest cross-selling or upselling opportunities.

C] Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is one of the key algorithms used to perform Market Basket Analysis. It efficiently generates frequent itemsets and association rules from transaction data. It works by iteratively discovering frequent itemsets with increasing item lengths.

D] Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Perform Market Basket Analysis on a given dataset using the Apriori algorithm.
2. Identify frequent itemsets that occur together in customer transactions.
3. Generate association rules based on the discovered itemsets to reveal item relationships and correlations.

E] Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found above. If you have your own dataset, you can replace it with the provided one. Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for the Apriori algorithm, with each transaction represented as a list of items.
